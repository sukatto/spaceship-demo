Scott Norton - Computing III - Assignment 10

Like assignment 9, this program allows the user to control the player ship (the green ship) using the up, down, left, and right keys (or their corresponding keys on the number pad seen on some keyboards).  The player also has 10 bullets.  These bullets can be fired using either the F key or the 5 key on the number pad.  However, this time there are also two different types of asteroids: A and B, which differ by shape.  Asteroid is a purely abstract class which has an angle at which it moves and a linear speed.  It has a virtual function for setting the location, since that is dependent on the shape of the asteroid, which is defined by the classes that inherit from it, AsteroidA and AsteroidB.  I was going to implement a rotational speed for each asteroid, however there were several issues with getting the rotation axis to move with the center of the asteroid, as well as getting the asteroid to move at all when using the functions required for rotating a convex shape.  The code can be compiled by running the command "make", and the program run by running the command "./assign10".
