This program was an assignment I had done for my Computing III course, in which the user controls the player ship (the green ship) using the up, down, left, and right keys (or their corresponding keys on the number pad seen on some keyboards).  The player also has a finite amount of bullets they can fire using either the F key or the 5 key on the number pad.  There are also a couple of asteroids and an enemy ship floating around, though they do not have any actual functionality other than just existing (no hitboxes etc), and were added just for the sake of demonstrating my knowledge of inheritance and polymorphism in OOP.  The code can be compiled by running the command "make", and the program run by running the command "./spaceshipDemo" in a terminal window.
